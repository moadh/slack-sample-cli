#gitKata
The purpose of this kata is to learn some of the good and effective habits for source control while using git. 

##Introduction

This kata contains 2 workflows 

* Resetting, Checking Out, and Reverting operations
* Merge and Rebase

We'll go through each of them.

In this Kata we will create a custom bot for our newly created Slack channel.

botty-one : A silly little bot that gives weather informations.
